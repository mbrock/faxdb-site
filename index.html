<p><b>faxdb</b> is a simple document database for real-time and
offline sync.

<p>It treats a

<dl>

<dt><dfn>document</dfn>

<dd>as a named entity containing a
  
<dt><dfn>log,

<dd>which is a sequence of

<dt><dfn>commits:

<dd>Git-style records, each containing a parent hash and some

<dt><dfn>facts:

<dd><abbr>json</abbr> values, representing updates
according to some

<dt><dfn>semantics,

<dd>pure JavaScript functions, transforming the

<dt><dfn>state,

<dd>a <abbr>json</abbr> value representing a view of the document.

</dl>

<p>Logs are append-only and facts are never forgotten.

This amounts to a form of <a href="#event-sourcing">event
sourcing</a>.

<p>New clients need only download the latest state and hash.  To keep in
sync, they can poll or stream, always only downloading the newest
commits.

<p>Clients capable of evaluating JavaScript can listen for commits and
update states with the same semantics as the server.

<h2>commit algorithm</h2>

<p>When a client pushes a commit, the server ensures that the parent
hash matches the current head.

<p>If the parent hash does not match the head, the client receives the
delta so it can try to rebase its changes and recommit.

<p>If the parent hash matches the head, the server attempts to apply
the semantic function to update its cached state.

<p>If the semantic function fails, the commit is abandoned.

<p>If the semantic function succeeds, the commit is recorded and
streaming clients are notified.

<h2>transactions</h2>

<p>When updating multiple documents, multi-commit transactions can be
crucial.

<p>When updating a single document, transactions are usually
unnecessary, since facts are atomic and semantics can update the state
arbitrarily.  Still, you might need them in some situations.

<p>Transactionality is not recorded in history.  It is only an aspect
of how the server performs commits.  So while replaying history,
inconsistent states can occur.
